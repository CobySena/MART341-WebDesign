1. In macro terms, the goal of my conceptual website would be to have it explain many of the state symbols, such as the state animals, birds, and flowers, of the various states, but for this project I will be "demoing" this concept with just Montana and just the 3 examples listed earlier. This is designed mostly to satisfy the curiosity of anyone who wants to know these things and will be more like a fun trivia site than a crucial database.
