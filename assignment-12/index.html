    Charles Bukowski [1920-1994] was one of the most famous of the American poets of his time. He was first published in his 20s., but gave up serious writing for the world of work and bars. He spent a lot of time roaming from job to job living in rooming houses from the East coast to the West coast before joining the United States Postal Service in Los Angeles. His life at that time bordered on insanity and death, two prevalent themes in his writing.

    Charles Bukowski was born Heinrich Karl Bukowski on August 16, 1920 in Andernach, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany where his father was serving as an American army sergeant. Bukowski claims he was illegitimate but records show his parents were married a year before his birth. His father tried to make a living as  building contractor after the war but this proved to arduous in the prevailing conditions in Germany and he moved back to the US in April 1923 and settled in Baltimore. The family name was anglicized in pronunciation from Boo-kof-ski to Boo-cow-ski and Heinrich Karl eventually became Henry Charles. The family moved to South Central Los Angeles in 1930.
