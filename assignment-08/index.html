      Lyrics
    </h1>
    I've been on the edge, so
    <br />
    I'm running away
    <br />
    The city doesn't sleep much
    <br />
    And I'm in a daze
    <br />
    I've had enough, had enough
    <br />
    Think I'm losing control
    <br />
    I might erupt, might erupt
    <br />
    Feel it taking ahold, yeah
    <br />
    Tell me, who's gon' stop me now?
    <br />
    <br />

    I don't need anyone to save me, I'm not on my own
    <br />
    Cursed my name and you smashed my bones
    <br />
    Try to break me, watch me lose control
    <br />
    One more piece and I might be whole, yeah
    <br />
    Everything to take, nothing left to prove
    <br />
    Please, don't make me wait, I don't wanna lose you
    <br />
    Tonight, let me be your Moonwalker
    <br />
    <br />

    I've been on the edge, so
    <br />
    I'm going insane (go insane, go insane)
    <br />
    The city doesn't sleep much
    <br />
    And I couldn't wait
    <br />
    I'm not enough, not enough
    <br />
    Yeah, I lost my control
    <br />
    I'm giving up, giving up
    <br />
    Yeah, it's taking my soul
    <br />
    Tell me, who's gon' stop me now?
    <br />
    <br />

    I don't need anyone to save me, I'm not on my own
    <br />
    Cursed my name and you smashed my bones
    <br />
    Try to break me, watch me lose control
    <br />
    One more piece and I might be whole, yeah
    <br />
    Everything to take, nothing left to prove
    <br />
    Please, don't make me wait, I don't wanna lose you
    <br />
    Tonight, let me be your Moonwalker
    <br />
    <br />

    I'm the man, bitch, I run my fucking city (yeah)
    <br />
    Came straight from the gutter, now these hoes are fucking with me
    <br />
    God-damn, I'm the man, bitch, don't need your fucking pity (nah)
    <br />
    Pray my soul to keep, but the reaper won't forgive me (move!)
    <br />
    <br />

    I don't need anyone to save me, I'm not on my own
    <br />
    Cursed my name and you smashed my bones
    <br />
    Try to break me, watch me lose control
    <br />
    One more piece-
    <br />
    <br />

    I don't need anyone to save me, I'm not on my own
    <br />
    Cursed my name and you smashed my bones
